# Invoice Processing Automation using RPA Technology

SYNOPSIS :
        By Definition it is a business function peformed by the accounts payable department which consists a series of steps for managing vendor or supplies invoices from receipt to payment and recorded in the general ledger. Usually this invoice processing is made manually which contains a lot of human errors and also a time-consuming work. This may also leads to loss of data and late due payment to vendor.
        So this Automation of Invoice Processing Project helps to eradicate all these errors by creating a “SMART BOT” using RPA technology. The bots will scan, digitize and validate key data from purchase orders to create invoices. The complete invoice process will get automated without any human intervention. It improves the cycle time of invoice processing and bills sooner in order to maximize the revenue by ensuring accuracy to every invoice dispatched. The bots will read and compile data and update the data on the portal and the mail will also be stored in a local repository for database.
