Usually this processing invloves manual works,which contains alot of human errors and also a time-consuming work.This in turn leads to loss of data annd late due payment to vendor.
So, This project helps to eradicate all these errors bby creating a "SMART BOT" using RPA Technology.The Bot will scan , digitize and validate a key data from purchase orders to create invoices.The complete process will be automated without any human intervention.
It improves the cycle time of invoice processing and bills sooner in order to maximize the revenue by ensuring accuracy to every invoice dispatched.The bots will read and compile data and update it on the portal and a mail will be also stored in a local repository for database.
